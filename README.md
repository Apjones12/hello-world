# hello-world


Hello everyone! 
I go by Apjones12 and I am a beginner programmer learning java.
I have been teaching myself for about 2 months now after work and on the weekends.
So far I have completed a few different core tutorials and read a lot of the Java Tutorials by Oracle.
Now I am trying to put my new found knowledge to the test by creating my own programs!
Applying the concepts I have learned is getting easier day by day as I gain a better understanding of them and learn new things on the way!
Heres to a life of learning!
